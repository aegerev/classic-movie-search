### User Story
AS A classic movie enthusiast,
I WANT to search for classic movies by title
SO THAT I I can discover and learn more about the films I love.

### Acceptance Criteria
The app allows users to search for movies by title (full or partial), actor (name or filmography), director (name or filmography), or genre (dropdown menu with a variety of classic movie genres).
The search results are displayed in a clear and concise format, including movie title, year of release, poster image (if available).
Search results should be filtered by user selection (title, actor, director, genre) and display only relevant movies.
Movie Details:
Clicking on a movie result takes the user to a detailed movie info page.
The movie info page displays the title, year of release, director, cast (including lead actors), genre(s), synopsis, runtime, and user rating (if available from an integrated service).
